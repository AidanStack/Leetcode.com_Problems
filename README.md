# Leetcode.com_Problems
  Leetcode.com is a well known website that provides coding challenges of various difficulties. Meant to train people for the often rigorous technical interview quesitons asked by tech companies, leetcode has joined codewars.com as one of my go to places to reinforce the syntax I know, and practice coming at problems programatically. 

  All of the solutions in this repository are completely my own, completed with no outside help or tutorial (other than looking up method syntax on stackoverflow). 
  
  Here I am of course showcasing what I feel are my most impressive solutions, but a full picture of all the solutions I have come up with can be found on my leetcode profile page at https://leetcode.com/AidanStack/
